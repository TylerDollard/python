    "The excerpt also introduces the authors of a deep learning course and their teaching philosophy, emphasizing hands-on learning, simplicity, and practical experimentation. It discusses the choice of software tools like PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks for deep learning projects and provides guidance on setting up a GPU server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the excerpt serves as an introduction to deep learning, covering its history, key concepts, practical implementation, and learning methodologies, with a focus on real-world problem-solving and experimentation."
