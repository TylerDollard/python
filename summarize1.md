The passage highlights the challenges early neural network models face, including the limitations Minsky and Papert identified.

It then explores the resurgence of interest in neural networks in the 1980s and 1990s, fueled by the publication of the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) book. The text discusses the importance of multi-layer networks and the theoretical underpinnings of neural network architectures

The excerpt also introduces the authors of a deep learning course and their teaching philosophy, emphasizing hands-on learning, simplicity, and practical experimentation It discusses the choice of software tools like PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks for deep learning projects and guides setting up a GPU server.

Overall, the excerpt serves as an introduction to deep learning, covering its history, key concepts, practical implementation, and learning methodologies, with a focus on real-world problem-solving and experimentation. The concept of machine learning and neural networks is explored within the framework proposed by Arthur Samuel. Samuel suggested treating a model as a special kind of program whose behavior is determined by its weights or parameters. He emphasized the importance of automatic testing of a model's performance and the need for mechanisms to adjust the weights to improve performance, leading to automatic learning.

The excerpt introduces the terminology used in modern deep learning, such as architecture (referring to the functional form of the model), parameters (weights), predictions (results calculated by the model), and loss (measure of performance). It also highlights the importance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as a general method for updating the weights of a neural network to improve its performance.

Furthermore, the limitations inherent to machine learning are discussed, including the reliance on labeled data for training, the inability of models to take recommended actions, and the potential for biased feedback loops in model training and deployment.
